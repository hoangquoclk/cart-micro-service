## Services

By now, the functional services are still decomposed into four core services. Each of them can be tested, built and deployed independently and has its own swagger documentation.

- Provides endpoints for user registration, login, and token generation;
- Has its own postgres database to store and control users data.

| Method | Path                          | Description            |

|DELETE  | /user/delete                  | Delete the current user|

### [Api Gateway](https://github.com/ViniciussMelo/cart-microservice/tree/master/api.gateway)
- Acts as a single entry point for client requests;
- Responsible for authenticate and unify the ```api.cart``` and ```api.product``` into one URL.

| Method | Path           | Description                                      |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|POST    | /carts         | Call ```api.cart``` and add a item to a cart     |
|DELETE  | /carts/{id}    | Call ```api.cart``` and delete a item from a cart|
|GET     | /carts/{id}    | Call ```api.cart``` and get the cart by id       |
|POST    | /products      | Call ```api.product``` and create a new product  |
|GET     | /products      | Call ```api.product``` and get all products      |
|GET     | /products/{id} | Call ```api.product``` and get product by id     |
|GET     | /health        | Get application health                           |

### [Api Cart](https://github.com/ViniciussMelo/cart-microservice/tree/master/api.cart)
- Provides endpoints to manipulate the cart;
- Listen the ```product.created``` topic from ```api.product``` to get new products;
- Has its own postgres database to store and control cart data.

| Method | Path           | Description              |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
|POST    | /carts         | Add a item to a cart     |

|GET     | /products      | Get all products      |
|GET     | /products/{id} | Get product by id     |

## IMPROVEMENTS
- Add 100% test coverage;
- Add more endpoints to the microservices;
- Remove duplicate files/functions by creating an internal package and installing/sharing that package across projects that are using the same files/functions.
